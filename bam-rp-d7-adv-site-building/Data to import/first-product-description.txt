Title: Airspeed Velocity T-Shirt

Body:
An awesome shirt from ThinkGeek (and officially sanctioned by Monty Python) that references an xkcd discussion about what the actual equation is for the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow (a question posed by the keeper of the bridge in "Monty Python and the Search for the Holy Grail"). The shirt is white ink printed on a dark t-shirt and is available for men or women.
