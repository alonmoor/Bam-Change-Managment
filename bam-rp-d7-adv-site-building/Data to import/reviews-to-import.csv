Remote Control Helicopter With Water Cannon,"Surely you've noticed the yearly exponential growth in tiny remote controlled vehicles. It's a veritable epidemic, and yet somehow the effect of seeing a miniature hovering machine never seems to get old. It's time to capitalize on that big time. This particular helicopter comes equipped with a water cannon, which is just a fancy way of describing a flying squirt gun that <em><strong>YOU CONTROL</strong></em>!!","This flying gem is one of the highlights of this year's best in giftability. It carries a heavier price tag than some, but if you're shooting for the $30-$50 range (so to speak), this is your ticket to becoming somebody's favorite, at least for a day.And being someone's favorite is exactly the position you want to be in when gifting this bugger, because you don't want to end up on the bad side of a friend you've just handed over aquatic weaponry to.Minus the potential dangers, we found that this guy was pretty responsive to the controls, and while it was hard to hit a bullseye from 5 feet away, you can get some pretty good directional control of the water stream.Definitely awesome for giftability, not so weird (which is good for some), and hits a pretty high rank for funness (though a little igniter and the option to use lighter fluid would have been a nice touch).",10,8,3,squirting-helicopter.jpg
Useless Box Kit,"The name of this cutie is deceiving. While the box doesn't perform the typical box-like of getting filled up, hidden away, and found years later only to be shipped off to some thrift store were some unexacting soul will come to buy it and do exactly the same thing. The purpose of this box is pure entertainment. First, you get to build it with a kit, and then you can get endless entertainment turning the box on and watching it turn itself off.","It took us a while to figure out what we were looking at when we gathered around the computer screen like a group of preschoolers around a chocolate marshmallow that's fallen on the ground. What is it? Can we eat it? (we asked ourselves)When we finally got the joke, our lack of observational skills proved as a true joy enhancer. First of all, the recipient of this particular gift will get to spend a solid 40 minutes putting this contraption together, and when it's done it will do one thing endlessly: Whenever you flip the switch, the box will open, and a finger will pop out to flip the switch back off. That's it. If only all of our appliances were this energy efficient!This particular gift gets a fantastic weirdness score, but it's really for a particular group of people. So while it lacks in overall giftability, it can be just the right thing for the right person. We spent a solid 5 minutes turning this sucker on (but not off!), and those 5 minutes were fantastic. But beyond that, enjoying this box involves exposing new people to it. Repeatedly.",5,7,10,useless-box.gif
Canned Unicorn Meat,"Not actual meat, this can includes a collection of severed plush unicorn parts. Invented at ThinkGeek, this can has the same form factor as Spam, but without the traditional stigma (in everywhere but Hawaii and a couple other places). As warned, this is not intended for true consumption, but if you do happen to eat it, it's guaranteed to glitter on its way out!","We've been looking hard for smaller gifts for stockings and for those from large families, and we think we've found a winner. And this finally answers the question as to whether you can fit happiness and giggles into a can.We bought a few of these to test out some of our employee's kids, and found the reactions vacillating between unnerving fits of hysterical laughter and outright horror. It became clear to use that this particular gift should come with an NC-8 rating (actual age may vary between families). But besides having to sew the pieces back together for the littlest recipient, this ended up being an overall hit (and the re-constituted unicorn almost made up for the initial terror in the little one).A fantastic desk ornament with guts (really!), this is a great gift for virtually anyone, and can even be purchased in bulk as a joke to sneak into the pantries of those end-of-the-worlders who horde canned goods. Wouldn't it be great to see their faces when they're down to their last 10 cans and they open them one by one to find they actually contain pieces of a stuffed (arguably) fictional hoofed beast? Ha ha ha!!!",9,7,10,unicorn-meat.jpg
