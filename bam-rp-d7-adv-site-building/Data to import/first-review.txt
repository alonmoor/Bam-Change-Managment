Title: Review of "Airspeed Velocity T-Shirt"

Body:
We're not talking about taking a sip of coffee here. No, this is about a profound ornithological question that many of us remember from our childhoods. And if you're like me, you remember it completely <em>unanswered</em>.

While ThinkGeek did not come up with the answer to the classic question "What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow", they have built a beautiful mechanism whereby you can spread the word. This black shirt - unlike many we've reviewed here on GOG - manages to provide ad least a modicum of resistance to dryer lint, and the ink is definitely solidly in place.

We tested this shirt out in a variety of context, and found it <strong>most popular</strong> at a random LARP event, <strong>least popular</strong> at a gardening gala.

Overall, this would be a great gift for individuals who need the confidence boost that comes from potentially being the only one that understands what's on your own t-shirt.
