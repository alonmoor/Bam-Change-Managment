Betty Davis,"One of our most active contributors and excellent fire-breather, Betty has a long history of geekdom and accurately represents the interests of geeks around the world (except in Burundi, where geekdom has a slightly different meaning). Betty comes to GOG with an eye towards spreading joy and excitement to geeks around the world who might be too engaged in other stuff to search the web for things that they might find entertaining.",betty-davis.jpg,http://whybettydavisrocks.example.com,betty@giftofgeek.com
Jones Jones,"That's really his name. Jones is a the tallest of our group, and doesn't get a chance to write as much as the rest of us due to the fact that he's always getting things down for us from the top shelf in the office closet. We've thought about moving it down, but the thing is that Jones is also one of our most controversial writers and we end up having to beef up our servers whenever he writes something new. So we don't crash our servers too often, we like to keep him busy.",jones-jones.jpg,http://jonesyouknowimawesome.example.com,jones@giftofgeek.com
Benj Kalhut,"Benj, the founder of GOG, is kind of a wild guy. When he's not pretending to be a flying squirrel, he's eating ghost peppers or drilling holes in his skull for experimental mental augmentation. Benj is also an avid fan of geek, and wants to spread the word about awesome stuff he finds online.",benj-kalhut.jpg,http://webenjwebenj.example.com,benj@giftofgeek.com
